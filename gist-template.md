## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors' jobs aren't to match characters, but rather to assert where in the engine the search takes place. Namely, the beginning or end of a string.

### Quantifiers

The quantifiers exist to determine exactly how many times an expression is repeated in a search.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs deal with smaller subsets of both the regular expression and the input string.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions exist inside of opening and closing square brackets, and ultimately define a set of characters to search for.

### Character Classes

Character classes exist inside of the bracket expressions; they determine which specific characters will be searched for.

### The OR Operator

'Or' operators allow the users to pick between one set of characters and another. For example: (A *or* B, C *or* D). In this example, all of the following meet the requirements: (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), and (B, D).

### Flags

A flag determines if/when a regular expression will search in a different way.

### Character Escapes

Character escapes (indicated by a back slash) are used when you need to search for a specific character and, in doing so, rid it of any intrinsic coding-language value.
