## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors' jobs aren't to match characters, but rather to assert where in the engine the search takes place. Namely, the beginning or end of a string.

### Quantifiers

The quantifiers exist to determine exactly how many times an expression is repeated in a search.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs deal with smaller subsets of both the regular expression and the input string.

### Bracket Expressions



### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes
